Problem Description 



Before applying time-series forecasting models, it is essential to verify whether the stock’s Close price data is stationary, as many statistical models assume constant mean, variance, and autocovariance over time. Non-stationary data can lead to misleading forecasts and unreliable model performance. 



Using the same historical Close price dataset, the firm applies the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to evaluate stationarity. Since stock prices typically exhibit trends, the analysis includes transforming the data through first-order differencing if non-stationarity is detected. 



The visualization shows the differenced Close price series, which represents the change in price between consecutive periods. 



Analysis Description 



ADF Test on Original Close Price (3.1) 



The ADF test is first applied to the raw Close price series. 
Due to the presence of a clear upward trend and evolving mean, the test typically fails to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the original series is non-stationary. 


First-Order Differencing and ADF Test (3.2) 



First-order differencing is performed by computing the change between consecutive Close prices. 
The ADF test is then reapplied to the differenced series. 
The test result generally rejects the null hypothesis, confirming that the differenced series is stationary. 


Differenced Data Visualization and Pattern Interpretation (3.3) 



The plotted differenced series fluctuates around a mean close to zero, with no visible long-term trend. 
Variance appears relatively stable over time, satisfying key stationarity conditions. 
Sharp positive and negative spikes represent sudden price changes driven by short-term market events. 
The absence of persistent patterns suggests that most trend effects have been successfully removed. 


Objectives 



Validate stationarity of stock prices 



Use the ADF test to assess whether the original Close price series meets stationarity requirements. 


Apply transformation techniques 



Perform first-order differencing to remove trend and stabilize the mean. 


Interpret differenced time series behavior 



Analyze fluctuations around zero to confirm stationarity. 
Identify volatility clusters and abrupt price movements. 


Prepare data for forecasting models 



Ensure the transformed series is suitable for ARIMA and other time-series models. 
Improve model reliability by working with stationary data.

   This process ensures that the stock price data is properly conditioned for accurate and robust forecasting analysis.
