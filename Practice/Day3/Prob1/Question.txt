Stock Price Forecast Visualization Using ARIMA 



A financial analytics team is analyzing historical stock price data to understand price trends and evaluate forecasting performance. Stock prices are inherently non-stationary due to long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. To address this, the team applies an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, which uses differencing to handle non-stationarity while preserving temporal dependencies. 



The dataset contains monthly stock price information along with engineered features such as price differencing, simple moving averages (SMA), and single exponential smoothing (SES). The historical data is divided into training and test periods, and an ARIMA(1,1,1) model is trained on the training set to forecast future closing prices. 



Your task is to visualize and interpret the forecasting results to assess model behavior, forecast accuracy, and residual patterns. 



 



Visualization Tasks 



Actual vs Forecast Plot 
Create a line plot showing: 
Training period closing prices 
Actual closing prices for the test period 
Forecasted closing prices generated by the ARIMA(1,1,1) model 
Clearly label axes, add a legend, and include an informative title. 
Forecast Interpretation 
Visually analyze how well the forecast follows the actual stock price movement during the test period. Highlight any noticeable under- or over-prediction trends. 
Residual Analysis Plot 
Plot the residuals (Actual − Forecast) over time for the test period to identify: 
Systematic patterns 
Bias in predictions 
Periods of high forecasting error 
Model Evaluation Visualization Support 
Use the plots to support quantitative evaluation results (MAE, RMSE, and MAPE) by explaining how visual deviations correspond to numerical error values. 
Comparative Insight 
Based on visual evidence, discuss whether differencing in ARIMA improves forecast stability when compared to an ARMA-style behavior (flat or mean-biased forecasts). 
 

Expected Outcome 



By completing this visualization task, learners should be able to: 



Interpret time-series forecasts visually 
Understand the impact of differencing on non-stationary stock data 
Identify forecast bias using residual plots 
Connect visual insights with statistical evaluation metrics 


This question assesses practical skills in time-series visualization, model interpretation, and forecast diagnostics using real-world financial data.
