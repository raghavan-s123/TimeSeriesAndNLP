Stock Price Forecasting Using AR/MA Models 



In financial time-series analysis, forecasting future stock price movements is essential for decision-making and risk assessment. This problem focuses on using AutoRegressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models to predict future changes in a stock’s closing price and evaluate the effectiveness of these models. 



You are provided with a historical stock price dataset containing monthly observations of Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and engineered features such as Close price differences (Close_diff), Simple Moving Averages (SMA_10, SMA_30), and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES). The Close_diff variable represents the month-to-month change in the closing price and serves as the target variable for modeling. 



The dataset is divided into training and testing periods. An MA model with auto-selected parameters is fitted on the training data to capture short-term dependencies and noise patterns in the differenced closing prices. Using the fitted model, forecasts are generated for the test period and compared against actual observed values. 



Objectives 



Forecast Generation 
Use an AR or MA time-series model to forecast future values of the stock’s closing price (or its differenced form) over the test period. 
Visual Evaluation 
Plot the training data, actual test values, and model forecasts on a single graph to visually assess how well the model tracks real market movements. 
The training data shows historical behavior. 
The actual test data represents real observed fluctuations. 
The forecast line illustrates the model’s predicted values. 
Performance Assessment 
Quantitatively evaluate forecast accuracy using standard error metrics: 
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – average magnitude of forecast errors. 
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) – relative error in percentage terms. 
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – penalizes larger errors and reflects overall prediction quality. 


Expected Outcome 



By completing this task, you will: 



Understand how AR/MA models can be applied to stock price forecasting. 
Interpret visual forecast plots to identify underfitting or overfitting. 
Use MAE, MAPE, and RMSE to objectively assess model performance. 
Gain insights into whether a simple MA model is sufficient to capture the volatility and dynamics present in real stock price movements. 


This analysis helps bridge statistical time-series modeling with practical financial forecasting and model evaluation.
