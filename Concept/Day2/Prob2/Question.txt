To accurately forecast short-term changes in electricity consumption, the firm develops an Autoregressive (AR) time-series model using the differenced power consumption data (Power_Consumption_diff). Since model performance depends heavily on selecting appropriate lag parameters, an automated, data-driven approach is adopted to identify the best AR configuration and validate its reliability. 



The analysis integrates model selection, diagnostic testing, forecasting, and performance evaluation, supported by visual comparison between actual and predicted values. 



Analysis Description 



1. AR Model Parameter Selection 



Multiple AR(p) models are evaluated by varying the lag order p (0–14). 
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used to compare models. 
The model with the lowest AIC is selected as the best-fitting AR model. 
Based on this process, AR(14) is identified as the optimal configuration. 


2. Model Fitting and Summary 



The selected AR(14) model is trained on the training subset of the differenced data. 
Model summary statistics confirm that lagged values significantly contribute to explaining current changes in power consumption. 


3. Residual Diagnostics (Ljung–Box Test) 



The Ljung–Box test is applied to model residuals to detect remaining autocorrelation. 
Test results show no significant autocorrelation at lag 1, indicating that: 
The AR model successfully captures temporal dependencies. 
Residuals behave like white noise, satisfying a key modeling assumption. 
 

4. Forecasting and Visualization 



The fitted AR model is used to generate forecasts on the test dataset. 
The visualization displays: 
Training data (blue): historical differenced consumption used for model fitting. 
Actual test data (orange dashed): observed consumption changes. 
Forecasted values (green dashed): model predictions. 


Observations 



Forecasted values closely follow the oscillatory pattern of the actual data. 
The model effectively captures short-term fluctuations, though some deviations occur during extreme spikes. 
 



5. Model Evaluation Metrics 



The forecast accuracy is assessed using standard error metrics: 



MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures average absolute deviation. 
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes larger errors more heavily. 
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Indicates relative forecast accuracy. 


These metrics demonstrate that the AR model provides a reasonable fit for short-term forecasting of differenced power consumption.
