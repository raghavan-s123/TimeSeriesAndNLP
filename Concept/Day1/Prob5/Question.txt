Electricity consumption time series data often exhibits long-term trends and seasonal patterns that make it non-stationary. Many time series forecasting models require the data to be stationary, meaning its statistical properties such as mean and variance remain constant over time. 



To address this, differencing is applied to the electricity consumption series to remove trends and stabilize the mean. The resulting differenced series highlights short-term changes in power consumption rather than absolute levels. 



In this task, you are required to analyze the differenced electricity consumption plot shown in the visualization. 





Objectives 



Understand the effect of differencing 
Observe how differencing transforms the original consumption data. 
Verify whether long-term trends have been reduced or removed. 
Assess stationarity of the series 
Examine whether the differenced values fluctuate around a constant mean (near zero). 
Check for consistency in variance over time. 
Identify remaining seasonal or cyclical behavior 
Observe repeating oscillations that may indicate unresolved seasonality. 
Determine whether additional seasonal differencing is required. 
Detect abrupt changes or anomalies 
Identify large spikes or drops representing sudden changes in consumption. 
Consider whether these values correspond to special events or irregular behavior. 
Prepare data for time series modeling 
Use insights from the differenced plot to decide on suitable forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA). 
Determine appropriate model parameters based on observed patterns.
