Electricity consumption data often contains multiple underlying components that influence its behavior over time, such as long-term growth, seasonal usage patterns, and random fluctuations. Simply observing the raw consumption values may not be sufficient to fully understand these influences. 



To gain deeper insights, time series decomposition is used to break down electricity consumption into its constituent components: trend, seasonality, and residuals. This helps analysts understand the drivers of consumption and prepare the data for accurate forecasting and modeling. 



In this task, you are required to analyze the decomposed electricity consumption time series shown in the visualization. 





Objectives 



Analyze the overall consumption pattern 
Observe the original electricity consumption series to understand its variability over time. 
Identify visible fluctuations and overall behavior. 
Examine the trend component 
Identify long-term increases or decreases in electricity usage. 
Understand how demand has evolved across years independent of seasonal effects. 
Interpret the seasonal component 
Detect repeating patterns that occur at regular intervals (e.g., monthly or yearly). 
Understand cyclical consumption behavior caused by weather, habits, or recurring events. 
Evaluate the residual component 
Analyze irregular fluctuations not explained by trend or seasonality. 
Identify possible anomalies, noise, or unexpected events affecting consumption. 
Prepare insights for forecasting and modeling 
Use decomposition results to determine whether the data is suitable for time series models. 
Decide if additional preprocessing such as smoothing or anomaly handling is required.
