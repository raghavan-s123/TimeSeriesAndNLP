Understanding the temporal dependence in electricity consumption data is essential for selecting appropriate time series models and making reliable forecasts. Electricity usage at a given point in time is often influenced by past values due to habitual usage patterns, seasonal effects, and long-term trends. 



To evaluate these dependencies, an autocorrelation analysis is performed. The autocorrelation plot (ACF) illustrates how strongly current electricity consumption is correlated with its past values across different time lags. 



In this task, you are required to analyze the autocorrelation plot of electricity consumption shown in the visualization. 



 

Objectives 



Analyze short-term dependencies 
Observe autocorrelation values at smaller lags. 
Determine whether recent past consumption strongly influences current consumption. 
Identify seasonality through repeating patterns 
Detect cyclical peaks and troughs in autocorrelation values. 
Infer the presence of seasonal patterns based on regular oscillations in the plot. 
Assess long-term correlation decay 
Examine how autocorrelation decreases as lag increases. 
Understand whether the series exhibits persistence or mean-reverting behavior over time. 
Evaluate statistical significance 
Use the confidence bounds to identify which lags show statistically significant autocorrelation. 
Distinguish meaningful temporal relationships from random noise. 
Support model selection and preprocessing 
Use insights from the autocorrelation structure to guide the choice of forecasting models (e.g., AR, MA, ARIMA, SARIMA). 
Decide whether differencing or seasonal adjustments are required before modeling.
